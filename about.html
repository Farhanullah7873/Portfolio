    <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
 <p>Hello! I’m Farhan Khan, a driven Full Stack Developer and Creative Designer with 2.5+ years of experience building custom-coded, high-performance web applications and designing stunning visual content.

My toolkit includes JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, C++, and the full MERN Stack, giving me the flexibility to handle everything from user interfaces to back-end APIs and databases.

But I’m not just a coder — I’m also a visual storyteller. With a strong background in graphic design, I create digital assets, UI mockups, logos, and branding that help businesses stand out and connect with their audience.</p>
<h2>💡 My Mission</h2>
<p>I believe that the best digital experiences are built when technology and design work together. My goal is to craft solutions that are functional, beautiful, and user-friendly, whether it’s a startup’s first MVP, a custom dashboard for a small business, or eye-catching visuals for a marketing campaign.</p>
<h2>⚙️ How I Work</h2>
<ul>
    <li>✅ Clean, Scalable Code — I follow best practices to ensure that my code is reliable, maintainable, and future-proof.</li>
    <li>✅ Collaborative Mindset — I love working with clients, designers, and teams to turn ideas into reality.</li>
    <li>✅ Creative Edge — I bridge the gap between development and design, ensuring that every project is visually polished and technically robust.</li>
</ul>
